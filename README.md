Assignment Objectives:
1. Fetch Current Location and Show weather to User
2. User can search for a city and Display weather for that city
3. User can save that location
4. User can see the list of locationsn saved alongwith weather for those locations 


Instructions to run:

The project is build using expo, so before running the project install npm modules. 
Make sure the dependencies are matched with the package.json file

Extra points to be noted:
1. I have implemented refresh button to update the list of cities. 
2. the delete button deletes the city saved.
3. Search city button gets the city enetered based on Text Input.


Future Updates Possible and planning to implement:
1. Generic methods to be used to optimize code quality
2. Include Google API to pre populate city name
3. Inlcude animations to smoothen transitions.
4. Inlcude filters to sort the cities.
